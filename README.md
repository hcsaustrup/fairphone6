# My FairPhone 6 Notes

## Applications

### MitID

#### Missing link association

Problem: Instead of the MitID app, a page opens in your browser.

Solution:

* Go to Apps
* Go to Default Apps
* Go to Opening links
* Go to MitID
* Ensure "Open supported links" is enabled
* Ensure any additional links are enabled too

### MobilePay

#### Browser misbehaving

Problem: "The authentication failed. Please try again later" during validation flow.

Solution:

* Force stop + clear data for Chrome
* Select Chrome as default browser
* Start Chrome and complete first-time wizard
  * DO NOT SELECT PRIVACY PROTECTION
* Force stop + clear data for MobilePay (if you've attempted this before)
* Run MobilePay and complete validation procedure
* Change default browser back to Firefox etc.

#### Locked out

Problem: Error E4005 (Account locked by MobilePay security)

Solution: Call/chat them to get it removed.
